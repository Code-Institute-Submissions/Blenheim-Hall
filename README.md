# Blenheim Hall
 
Welcome to my first project, the link to the website is here:
 
https://kimtroop89.github.io/Blenheim-Hall/
 
I've decided to build a website around a wedding venue as I think it's a fun way to showcase my newly acquired skills. I’ve tried to build the website so that it looks as aesthetically pleasing as possible since this is probably the biggest factor for someone searching for a wedding venue. If the style of the venue is demonstrated through the website, it gives the user an image in their head of what their wedding could look like here.
 
This project is based on my own idea, I haven’t used the project examples. I got married 2 years ago, and have several friends getting married at the moment so I feel like I have a good understanding of what this type of website should look like.
 
## UX
 
My original mock up design is uploaded in the "additional material folder". I have changed the format slightly as I started building the code, as I thought this layout worked better and looked more simple.
 
This website would be built for the owners of a Wedding venue, to be used as firstly a marketing tool but also for a way for potential customers to book an appointment to visit the venue. The consistent theme throughout and lots of beautiful images (that would be real life images if this was a real venue!) will basically allow the venue to “sell itself” so that’s why i’ve focused on making it look really elegant and classy.
 
The form is a quick way for users to submit an enquiry, rather than having to email/phone up separately. I believe users would be more inclined to submit an enquiry using this form as it’s quick and easy, and can be done immediately while browsing the website.
 
 
 
### Features
 
On each page I have added a large banner image, this is to set the tone of the page, whilst showing the user (what would be if this was real) real images from the venue. It also ties in the style of the website through each page.
 
I have included a nav bar at the top so the information can be separated out into sections, making it easier for the user to digest the information and look at certain elements that might interest them more.
 
In the footers I have included links to social media sites. These link to the landing pages for each site, however they would direct to the wedding venue’s pages, with the idea that users would do some social media research of their own. I have also included a little “Winner 2019 Venue Awards” which is made up for this purpose, but would impress the user that the venue is that good it has won awards.
 
On the food page I have included menu cards that link to a PDF, which opens in a new tab. These link to sample menus that users can download and peruse at their own leisure.
 
On the enquire page I have included a form, this allows the user to submit their details in order to arrange a viewing of the venue. This is the ultimate goal of the website, to get an enquiry from a user.
 
On the gallery page I have included a carousel of images, this is a chance to show off the real weddings that have taken place at this venue, to allow the user to imagine what their big day could look like here.
 
Potential future features:
 
I would like to include a map in the footer that would give the user a better indication of the location of the venue. Possibly using Google maps so the user could easily see how far the venue is from them.
 
I would also like to include a video, possibly on the index page, of a real life wedding.
 
### Technologies used
 
I have written this using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and the website is being hosted on Github pages.
 
I have used Google fonts to create the right style in the website: https://fonts.google.com/.
 
I have also used Font Awesome to add icons into my content: https://fontawesome.com/.
 
I used a JQuery in order to create a burger menu for my navbar, this was taken from: https://getbootstrap.com/.
 
 
### Testing
 
I tested my website on all available screen sizes in the inspect page, to ensure everything looked as I wanted. I tweaked my media queries accordingly from there.
 
I physically loaded the website from the link onto a desktop, Amazon tablet, iPhone X and iPhone 8. I carried out all of the below tests on these devices:
 
Navbar:
- Clicked on each link on desktop, was sent to the correct page
- Completed the same but on a smaller device where the menu changed to burger menu, was sent to the correct page here too

Footer link:
- Clicked on each link on each screen size tested on, found that the links directed me to the landing page of each Social Media site, as intended

Banner image:
- When testing on each screen size, I checked the banner image displayed correctly, and also the media query to reduce the image height worked at 575.98px. Each output was as intended.

Downloadable menus:
- Clicked on the links to the downloadable menus
- They each opened in PDF format, and opened in a new tab as intended, leaving the original page
- This was carried out on each device and worked in the same way each time.

Enquiry Form:
- Firstly tried to submit with no information, this didn’t work and a message displayed to fill out the first field. This is what I expected.
- Secondly tried to submit the information with only the Name and no other information added. Received the same information as above from the Email Address box.
- Then I filled in all sections and hit the submit button, which did lead to the data submitting. So all worked as expected.

Image carousel:
- Firstly checked that the images moved along the slideshow for each device 
- Checked that the control buttons worked to skip to a different image, these also did work
- Checked that all 4 images were included in the carousel correctly.
 
#### Deployment
 
To deploy my project to GitHub Pages I created a master branch.
 
 
###### Credits
 
I used several bits of code from Bootstrap, including:
Navbar
Image carousel
Columns
Media Queries
Block divider
 
I also took inspiration from previous mini projects (Whiskey Drop and Rosie), so my use of rows and columns was taken from these projects. 
 
I copied the code from Whiskey Drop for my banner headers, although I didn’t style it exactly in the same way.
 
The form layout I also took from the Rosie project, but again I styled it differently. I took inspiration from the downloadable CV for my menu cards where I have added a link to menu PDFs.
The photos that I used in the website were from https://unsplash.com/ and https://www.pexels.com/.
