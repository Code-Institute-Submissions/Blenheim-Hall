Welcome to my first project, the link to the website is here:

I've decided to build a website around a wedding venue as I think it's a fun way to showcase my newly acquired skills. I’ve tried to build the website so that it looks as aesthetically pleasing as possible since this is probably the biggest factor for someone searching for a wedding venue. If the style of the venue is demonstrated through the website, it gives the user an image in their head of what their wedding could look like here.
 
This project is based on my own idea, I haven’t used the project examples. I got married 2 years ago, and have several friends getting married at the moment so I feel like I have a good understanding of what this type of website should look like.
 
## UX
 
My original mock up design is uploaded in the "additional material folder". I decided to remove the gallery page as I didn’t think it added any value since there are a number of images throughout the other pages.
 
This website would be for the owners of a Wedding venue - to be used as a marketing tool but also a way for potential customers to book an appointment to visit the venue. The use of large banner images on each page gives the user a real feel for what the venue looks like, tied in with social media links for them to do their own research. The consistent style throughout gives an impression of style; modern, elegant and simple, which would give the user an idea of how their wedding would potentially look here.  
 
### Features

On each page I have added a large banner image, this is to set the tone of the page, whilst showing the user (what would be if this was real) real images from the venue. It also ties in the style of the website through each page.

I have included a nav bar at the top so the information can be separated out into sections, making it easier for the user to digest the information.

In the footers I have included links to social media sites. These link to the landing pages for each site, however they would direct to the wedding venue’s pages, with the idea that users would do some social media research of their own.

On the Food page I have included menu cards that link to a PDF, which opens in a new tab. These link to sample menus that users can download.

On the Enquire page I have included a form, this allows the user to submit their details in order to arrange a viewing of the venue. This is the ultimate goal of the website, to get an enquiry from a user.

Potential future features:

I would like to include a map in the footer that would give the user a better indication of the location of the venue.

I would also like to include an image carousel of “real life weddings at Blenheim Hall”.

### Technologies used
 
I have written this using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and the website is being hosted on Github pages.

I have used Google fonts to create the right style in the website: https://fonts.google.com/

I have also used Font Awesome to add icons into my content: https://fontawesome.com/
